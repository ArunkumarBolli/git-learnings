
-> Github: it is cloud based repository to store source code & its files, hosted in web (same as GooleDrive)
  
-> pls create github account 
   https://github.com/

-> Git: version control tool/software, to access the github & its source files designed to manage all source code history. It can keep a history of commits, can reverse the changes and lets developers share code.

-> Install git tool in system to apply git commands through cmd/terminal
   https://git-scm.com/downloads

-> Open cmd
      git version                               ( to check verion )
      
                                                (need to login to git in sytem with github creds newly)
      git config --global user.name "your name" 
      git config --global user.email "your.name@domain.com"

Creating Repository in Github :
---------------------------
Repository:  similar to folder, to store the source code.

Repository -> New -> 
   Enter Repo Name :  java-files
   Description:
   Public/Private: 
  
  ->click on Create Repository 

we can upload files to github through manual upload or dragndrop or through git commands via cmnd

To push the code from local/computer to remote github:
-----------------------------------------------

-> create repository in github refer above
-> open cmd from local path where the source code is available
      type :  cmd + enter       (type cmd at path name)
      opens terminal

-> Git commands:
  #Push
  
     git init           (to intialize empty .git repostory in local work directory)
     git status         (red color: unstagged area , means not ready for push or not added)

     git add .          (to add all files in single shot)
     git add <filepath> (to add specific files as per our choice)
     git add -p         (to add specific lines from code file)

     git status         (green color: stagging area, means which is ready for push or added)

     git commit -m "first commit"  
                        (commiting to remote GitHub with custom mssg for the above added files, -m = mssg)

     git branch -M main (-M automatically renames the master branch to main in local, now above commited code in local main)


     git remote add origin https://github.com/Kranthi-45/git-learning.git
                        (github remote repo url where we want to push)

     git push -u origin main
                        (push the commited code in local main branch to remote repo)


To pull the code from remote github to local work directory
----------------------------------------------------
  #clone      				(only onetime when we copy code firstime)
     git clone <remote_repo_url>
     git clone https://github.com/Kranthi-45/React-Spring-MovieProject.git
 
  #Pull					(from nextonwards will pull only latest/new changes)
     git pull origin <brain_name>
     ex: git pull origin main

     

#other Git commands:
--------------------

    del .git                     (to del empty .git repo created in sytem)
    git branch                   (to show all branches in local)
    git branch -a                (to show all local & remote branches)
  
    git branch -M <branch_name>  (to rename main/parent branch to our desired branch name)
    ex:  
  	git branch -M main
	git branch -M master
        git branch -M development

        main or master or development    -   main or parent branch

    
    git fetch origin              (to fetch new branches from remote)



linux commands:
---------------

     ls          (to list all the files in specified location)
     ls -a       (to list all files & along with hidden)
     cd          (change directory)
     cd ..       (to go back onestep)
     clear       (to clear terminal)
